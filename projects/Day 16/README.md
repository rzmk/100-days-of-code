# Day 16 - Learning OOP with Python

- OOP concepts were taught in the source main.py file, such as classes, attributes, and methods. The Turtle and prettytable packages were also used to explore these concepts, and I installed prettytable in a virtual environment for this.
- The main objective of today is to simulate a coffee machine using OOP in the oop-coffee-machine folder. The coffee_maker.py, menu.py, and money_machine.py were given as abstract modules to work from in order to understand OOP.
