# Day 19 - Instances, State, and Higher Order Functions

- Built an etch-a-sketch while understanding higher order functions
- Simulated a turtle race with randomized steps using class instances

## Etch-a-Sketch

This etch-a-sketch uses higher order functions to run when keys are pressed on the keyboard.
- **w** - Move forwards
- **s** - Move backwards
- **a** - Turn left
- **d** - Turn right
- **c** - Reset etch-a-sketch

## The Great Turtle Race

The Great Turtle Race uses multiple instances of the Turtle object from [the turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) that move by a random number of steps to the edge of the screen.
