# Welcome to My 100 Days of Code!

Here you'll find many different projects I've built with **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and other tools/frameworks.

I've been building these projects from **[Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)**. It's really fun!

This website is built with **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** and continuously deployed on **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** which is routed to a subdomain on **[Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/)**.

The pages are collected from my README files within the projects folder in my **[repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rzmk/100-days-of-code)** for each day, scraped with **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** that runs on a **[Uvicorn ASGI server](https://www.uvicorn.org/)** which is hosted on **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)**.

:::note

Not all projects have READMEs for now, but will be added at a later date.

:::info How does this work?

Navigate from the sidebar or arrows at the bottom of each page to check out my projects and notes for each!

:::tip Pro Tip

I suggest enabling **Dark Mode** in the header.
Just a preference, but it's really cool!
